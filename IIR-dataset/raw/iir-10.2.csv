['non-overlapping pseudodocuments'],1,1,0,1,1,0,I think non-overlapping is easy to be understood

['document unit'],0,1,1,1,1,1,
['term statistics'],0,1,0,0,0,0,I think statistics is not specail

['pseudo-xpath notation'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
['retrieval'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
['nodes'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I think node in CS domain is always specail. Tree nodes?
['pseudodocuments'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
"['elements', 'element']",0,0,1,0,0,1,element is special in xml. The same as term in IR. XML element? 
"['subelements', 'subelement']",0,0,1,0,0,1,same as element
['typographical elements'],0,0,1,0,0,1,It's a kind of specific elements in XML. You can just google xml typographical elements. It refers to some specific elements
['path'],0,0,1,0,0,1,path in xml is also special.
['root node'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
['leaf node'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
['element types'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I think it is specail because people who don't know xml can never get the detail about it. XML element
"['schema', 'schemas']",0,0,1,0,0,0,
['content node'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I just think node should be a concept and content node is a specific kind of nodes. (is not widely use)
['sparse data problems'],1,0,1,1,1,1,
['xml-term pairs'],0,0,1,1,0,1,The oringal format is xml-content/term pairs. I just handle / as the way we handle and.
['parent node'],1,0,1,1,1,1,
['root'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I think root is special in CS domain
['intervening nodes'],0,0,1,0,0,1,intervening may be general. I'm not sure. I wonder if people without data structure knoweladge can understand what it is
['tree structure'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
['structural constraints'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I remember it appears many times in one section. It seems to be important
