['information needs'],1,1,1,1,1,1,
['structural criteria'],0,0,1,0,0,1,same as structural constraints. I think it appears too many times and seems to be important and specail
['content criteria'],0,0,1,0,0,1,it is an attribute of CAS query so I think it's specail
['tree'],0,1,1,1,1,1,
['information sought'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I google it and find some paper wright about this and I think it's a domain-specific term
['coverage'],0,0,1,0,0,1,It's the same as component coverage
['nested elements'],0,0,1,0,0,1,I think it's specail because it seems only can be used in CS domain

['inex 2002'],0,0,1,0,0,1,Well I don't know how to handle this kind of things
