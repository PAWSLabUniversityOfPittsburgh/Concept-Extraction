This project is on developing and evaluation of a systematic knowledge engineering approach for fine-grained annotation of textbooks with underlying knowledge in the form of concepts.

## Data

The dataset includes two parts: all the annotation files and some section samples from [IIR textbook](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html).

The input text file follows the format: <section_id>\<tab>\<section title>\<tab>\<section keywords>\<tab>\<section content>
```

iir_1_1	An example information retrieval problem	"AD HOC RETRIEVAL, INFORMATION NEED, QUERY, RELEVANCE"	"A fat book which many people own is Shakespeare's Collected Works. Suppose you wanted to determine which plays of Shakespeare contain the words Brutus AND Caesar and NOT Calpurnia..."
